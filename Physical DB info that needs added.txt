The best way to do this is NOT using the web form, that will be for non-computer savvy people later to add new players. I have a ruby script that can populate the DB. 
Players can be created in the form:


player1 = Player.create(f_name: ”Mark”, l_name: “Stumpf”, dob: “12/04/1991”, year: 4, height: 72, weight: 170, other_team: “old north state”)
player2 = Player.create(f_name: ”Mark”, l_name: “Stumpf”, dob: “12/04/1991”, year: 4, height: 72, weight: 170, other_team: “old north state”)

Add players in this form with a unique variable name [player1, player2 etc] to this doc:
